# Hi :)
Welcome to my portfolio. I'm using <a href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a> to build my ✨awesome✨ portfolio because it's a powerful web framework with excellent documentation.

Astro integrates seamlessly with <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind</a>, making all of Tailwind's utility classes available throughout the application.

Additionally, Astro uses <a href="https://vitejs.dev/">Vite</a> as its underlying build tool, which provides a smooth development experience.

## 🚀 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
